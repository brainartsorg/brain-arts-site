                            back in March and it has been challenging, but rewarding. I'm very passionate about hip-hop
                            and R&B music. Especially songs that tell a story. If I can feel the pain, then you're worth
                            writing about, which is why I created my website miixtapechiick.com. I wanted to amplify
                            those stories, while still covering mainstream artists. I've been with Brain Arts since
                            April, originally starting as a contributor for Underground Flex. In November, I became the
                            Compass Production Manager. It's so amazing to be apart of a team that loves music, arts and
                            culture like I do. I always tell my mother that I wish this was a full-time job.</p>
