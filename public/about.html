            <h1 style="text-align: center;" class="bao-font">History</h1>
            <br />
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                Brain Arts Organization began as Boston Compass, a free monthly zine distributed all over Boston
                advertising DIY happenings, founded by Samuel Potrykus in 2010. Later that year, co-founders Sam
                Potrykus and Dan Shea joined forces and began leveraging their combined 10+ years of booking around
                Greater Boston to form BostonHassle.com and then Boston Hassle Shows in 2011. The foundation of the
                organization at that time was the founders’ shared passion for all-ages programming and artists whose
                work defied categorization. After developing a significant following and volunteer base, Boston Hassle
                obtained 501(c)(3) status and formed Brain Arts Organization, Inc. (BAO) in 2013. A year later the group
                started the Brain Arts Market (then known as the Black Market Flea), a bi-monthly market with a focus on
                independent non-commercial artisans. BAM quickly became one of the most highly-attended markets in the
                area, often drawing over 1,000 visitors per event.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                Between 2014 and 2017 the group continued to commit countless volunteer hours to highlighting music and
                art shows as well as organizing festivals and branching out into arts advocacy. The addition of Molly
                Dower (Accountant) and Emma Leavitt (Creative Director) propelled the group to a new level of
                professionalism and sustainability. While in the pursuit of their own physical space, Potrykus recalled
                a space he had been to before, then called the Howard Art Project (HAP) in Fields Corner, Dorchester,
                where some friends had started a studio and gallery space. After reaching out to HAP to book Mourning A
                BlkStar (Cleveland) for a Hassle show, he discovered that his friends who ran the HAP (and also recently
                renamed it Dorchester Art Project) were looking for someone to take over the lease. With the help of
                Anya Smolnikova, Potrykus, Dower and their fellow volunteers officially took over operations at DAP in
                winter of 2017.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                In the past 3 years Dorchester Art Project (DAP) has blossomed into a community arts center complete
                with 15 artist studios, a gallery and exhibition space, storefront, co-working space and an intimate
                performance hall. DAP programming includes art exhibitions, music performances, monthly open mics, and a
                monthly and hourly creative space rental program. As of October 2020, programming was expanded to the
                ground floor at 1490 Dorchester Avenue where the group established a storefront selling the work of
                local artists. All DAP events are drug-free, all-ages, and open to the public. In 2019, DAP was proud to
                have been named Intimate Live Music Venue of the Year by the Boston Music Awards.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                Running DAP has transformed the mission of BAO, as the group quickly realized the only way to run the
                space equitably was to prioritize the hyperlocal community and commit to transforming from a
                volunteer-run collective into a sustainable organization with paid staff. BAO retained its dedication to
                artist-run operations, but in 2019 changed the mission to more appropriately reflect their commitment to
                equity and “systematically undervalued” artists.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                The journey continues into the new decade with several significant changes to the nonprofit. In the fall
                of 2019, BAO dropped the Boston Hassle as a project and re-focused their show booking and blogging
                efforts on the mission that guides them. BAO staff and volunteers continue to produce an independent
                culture blog and print publication under the Boston Compass Newspaper name, (bcnblog.com) and book
                all-ages concerts all over Greater Boston (including the first Damo Suzuki appearance in Boston in over
                10 years). In 2020 Brain Arts Organization welcomed Marc Drinkwater and Dorchester native Jelani Haynes
                to the board, and established an advisory board of local artists, administrators and community members
                who are committed to the success of the nonprofit’s mission. 2020 also saw the expansion of the
                leadership structure to include two more directors; Julia Schachnik as Director of People and Culture,
                and Devon Austrie as Director of Finance, bringing the organization to a new level of sustainability and
                stability.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                Although BAO’s strategic plan was upended due to the global coronavirus pandemic and subsequent Black
                Lives Matter uprising after the death of George Floyd, the adaptable nature of the nonprofit allowed it
                to continue growing its impact in the Greater Boston creative community, changing focus from shows and
                markets to mutual aid and protests, as well as maintaining the physical space of Dorchester Art Project
                and doubling down on digital publication efforts. In 2021, BAO looks forward to updating its board
                structure, inspired by <a
